The RPG Game Engine
-- yet to have an official name

base parts of the system

TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inventory currently has InventorySlot codes for "Any" and "AnyNonEquiped" consider moving these
to another variable to be passed in



Entities 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entities include all playable and non-playable characters in the game. entities can also 
be used for inanimate objects such as chests which can be thought of as essentially a dead
character with an inventory.

Entities are comprised of
Inventory Items
Skills
Abilities - A list of permissions on use of skills, actions
Stats
Effects
Type information such as race, gender.. visual aspects

Actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actions can only be performed by entities on entities with the only exception being the world
which may be treated as a special entity or entities. It could abuse the inventory to create
a playing map

World
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Contains all entities


Skills
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skills will be the primary mode of leveling up in the game. skills will include things such as
Spellcraft, Fishing, Swiming, Bartering, Weapon Use. Skill will not include individual item/spell information. 
For example "Fireball Spell" is not a skill but "Destruction Magic" may be. Skills can generalize use 
of serveral things or activities in the game where they apply. There should be many different types of skills
present in the game to give variaty of choice and the ability to build a character from how a player uses a character

Skill Leveling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skills level up when used. using fireball in tern uses the desctruction magic skill adding to its
skill level. the amount that is added to the skill will be stored in the same number as the skill level
the amount that is added will decrease as the skill level increases
current formula could be
skill inc. = percentDropPerLevel^floor(skill lvl)
When skills are leveled and reach the next whole number (rounding down) the skill has leveled up.

Skill Points
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a skill levels up a small fraction of skill points will be given to the player. this fraction when accumulated 
will go above 1. when this happens one skill point will be available to the player for use in increasing the players base line
stats. This number can go above 1.. 2... n... in which n skill points will be useable.
when skill points are used they are subracted from the skill point number leaving any remaining skill points and the fraction which
represents the progress to the next skill point.

Skill Point Bonuses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
at certain amounts of skill points more options for player development may become available.. such as additional skills
or % bonuses to resistences and other secondary base line stats (not available for increase by normal skill point usage)


Factory Creation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most things in the game will come from a set of factories. these factories will have all the 
random creation behavior built into them 
example:
GoblinFactory..
produces goblins at level one
gives them a random inventory based on level and perhaps occupation (wizard,warrior,digger,etc)
 


Enemy Creation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enemy entities (hostile entities) will be generated based on the level of the current player(s) via some yet to be
determined algorithm. Enemies should be generated and spaced such that in any given area/any grouping of enemies will
not exceed the players ability to have a chance of winning a confrontation.

this intruduces a concept of the level-density of an area
so if a point is chosen on the map the level-density of that area can be determined by all entities within attacking 
range of that area given some formula f() = sum(entity lvls)

this can be addressed when creating and placing the entities.
this could also be addressed after that fact by giving entities a tendency to attract/repel based on their combined stats.
